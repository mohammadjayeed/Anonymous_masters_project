This library contains utility functions for reading a certain number of bytes 
from a binary file then converting that data into a string. This feature is 
needed to read records from persistent data files.

# When one use a file to store many records of a single database relation then
# there must be a way to tell where a record ends in a file. Otherwise, if we
# start reading bytes from the file, we cannot stop reading. There are two ways
# to indicate record's ending. The common technique is to start a record with 
# an information about the length of the record. Then we can first read the 
# length first and then read as many bytes as the length suggest. This is the
# most versatile approach. Another common, but less versatile, approach is to 
# use a special string to mark the end of each record. So when reading, we keep
# reading bytes until we find the record separator. We will use this latter 
# approach for the current version of the database project. 
RECORD_SEPARATOR = "******"

# Since database systems store files in the binary format, the reading must be
# done in that format also. the following utility function let the user open a 
# file in binary mode for reading
def openFile(filePath):
    f = open(filePath, 'rb')
    return f


# When one opens a file, there is a file cursor that points to the beginning.
# As we read more and more bytes, the cursor advances. So all files are read 
# like this from the start till the end (or as long as we are interested in 
# reading). So if we want to change this behavior, and want to read from any 
# arbitrary index, we have to move the file cursor to the start of the location
# from where we want to read. This function does that cursor moving.
def jumpToReadingOffset(offset, fileHandle):
    fileHandle.seek(offset)
    
    
# This function reads the specified number of bytes from the file from its 
# current read location. Use this function when you know how many bytes you 
# want to read and are sure that the file has at least that much data from its
# current read cursor location
def readBytes(byteCount, fileHandle):
    chunk = fileHandle.read(byteCount)
    return chunk

# This function reads as many bytes as possible starting from the current file
# read cursor position until record separator string is found. Using this 
# function is convenient when we do not keep track database record lengths else-
# where in the system and consequently, do not know how many bytes to read to
# complete reading a single record.

    # of separatorArray. If the prefix become equivalent to the whole record
    # separator then it means we found the record ending

        # index; if it match that character then add the byte in the growing 
        # list of separator matcher list; otherwise add everything we did not
        # put into recordBytes yet into that list
