# This code illustrates how to open a binary file in append mode in Python
# so that one can add new things at the end of the file. If the file does 
# not already exist then it creates the file first.

# since opening and closing a file over and over again is a costly operation,
# it is better to open the file and keep the file object in hand then do 
# writing on the file through that object
def createOrOpenFileForAppend(pathToFile):
    # the second argument indicates we want to open the file for writing at the
    # end of it and we will do the writing in binary mode, which is much more 
    # space efficient than writing on a text file.
    # here 
    #   a: means appending to the end of the file
    #   +: means create the file if it does not exist
    #   b: means the file type is binary    
    f = open(pathToFile, 'a+b')
    return f

# this function can be used to append a new content at the end of a binary file
# that has been opened already; the function returns the index in the file where
# the writing started. This index should be useful for indexing.
def appendToFile(fileHandle, content):
    
    # Determine the end byte-index of the file before writing. We will need this
    # index for indexing
    writingStartsAt = fileHandle.tell()
    
    if (isinstance(content, str)):
        # if the content is an string then we first have to encode it before 
        # converting it into a binary array
        data = content.encode()
        binaryData = bytearray(data)
        fileHandle.write(binaryData)
    else:
        # for other data types, we first convert it to sting then write it to
        # the file
        strData = str(content)
        data = strData.encode()
        binaryData = bytearray(data)
        fileHandle.write(binaryData)
        
    return writingStartsAt        

# one should always close a file when it is no longer needed
def closeFile(fileHandle):
    fileHandle.close()
 
# This is a test function that will open a file, do some writing, and then 
# close it. This operation is repeated twice to show that file appending works
# properly
